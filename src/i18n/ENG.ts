    'decor-text2':
      "The special feature of the space is the natural stone finish and its combination with other materials and decorative elements, such as in the bathroom.\n\nAll the materials in the interior interact well with each other, revealing the designer's idea. The overall color scheme of the space is quite bold: the clients like rich colors, which is especially noticeable in the older child's bedroom, as well as in the hall and kitchen.",
    'decor-text3':
      "The story of the designer and the clients' acquaintance began in the summer, before the keys to the apartment were handed over to the owners - a young active couple with two children.\n\nAmong the wishes for the layout was a separate bedroom for the parents, as well as two children's rooms. This was realized by combining the living room and kitchen, since the developer initially provided for only two bedrooms. The room turned out to be bright and very comfortable.",

During the day and in the evening, artificial light intertwines with the rays of natural light, which creates a comfortable environment at any time of the day.',
